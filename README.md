### Note

This README is still WIP.

Any Pull Request is welcome, but please note that it may take some time for us to review it. Thanks for your patience.

If your updating firmware to 12.5x and have used BDJ or Lua before on lower firmwares you must have the latest GoldHEN on a fat32 or exfat usb, Partiton type must be MBR, On large USBs you will probably have to format with a tool like Rufus for this and GoldHEN needs to be renamed to payload.bin

GoldHEN embedded on the disc will always be used if using GoldHEN for the first time so please use a USB to update GoldHEN when there is a new release of the payload, the payload is copied to /data partition on your PS4 and will be used from then on

HenLoader can be used witn any other hen you prefer, just replace the payload.bin on the usb.

Please report any bugs you find to our Discord server https://discord.com/invite/pR5NTEVBGt
